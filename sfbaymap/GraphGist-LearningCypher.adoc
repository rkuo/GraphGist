= Learning Cypher with San Francisco Bay Map

== Objectives
The purpose of this exercise to learn graph database and some social network concepts by using commonly known domain: roads and cities. There is no specific problem I need to solve.

== Scenarios and Use Cases
Many of us use Google's map services everyday to find out what is the best way to go from point-A to point-B, is there an alternative, which way is the fastest or the cheapest. In spirited by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory[the original graph theory problem]: "The paper written by Leonhard Euler on the Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg and published in 1736 is regarded as the first paper in the history of graph theory", I will use a simplified San Francisco Bay road map to answer some questions. With 3 bridges in my graph, I may be able to ask more interesting questions in future.

I selected some major towns and highways connect them. For simplicity, initially I will only enter part of the data to start the learning.

== Model
I started with a simple model, just included nodes (cities) and links (highways).

Then I added more places, like university, sport stadium and airpor with a relationship [:has] to the city.

== What I learned?
* This is fun.
* I should use East PaloAlto as a node, instead of Athertron (node-26).
* What need to do next:
** look into the shortestPath algorithm and more complicate queries. 
** learn to write API and a web UI to interface server.

== Miscellaneous
The following information may not belong here, but I need to keep them all in one place for now.
Since I want to play the graph database in Gephi, so I need to export the data out. GraphML is the file format common to both Neo4j and Gephi. I followed http://inserpio.wordpress.com/2014/02/10/how-to-load-neo4art-graph-db-into-gephi/[Lorenzo Speranzoni's Blog-How to load Neo4Art Graph DB into Gephi] installed the tool, exported the data to GraphML file and imported into Gephi. I calculated some social network, eccentracity, closeness,etc, it works.

I installed Cytoscape and imported the same GraphML file, it works too. Very nice.
